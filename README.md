How do I approach designing software?
I begin by identifying clear objectives and understanding any constraints that might influence the final solution. This helps me decide on design methodologies like Model View Controller or an iterative, user-centered framework.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
During this project, I developed an eye for consistent aesthetics, improved my ability to organize assets and components effectively, and enhanced my capacity to adapt the user experience based on feedback.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I followed a process that involved defining requirements, creating quick prototypes, evaluating them, and refining features step by step.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These same tactics—such as clearly documenting goals, iterating on prototypes, and gathering feedback early—can be replicated on future projects to keep development focused and user friendly.


How do I approach developing programs?
My approach to program development involves breaking down functionality into smaller tasks, choosing suitable data structures and algorithms, and using clear coding standards.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I introduced strategic version control to track changes, maintained systematic organization of textures and models, and used performance checks to ensure smooth rendering.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration played a central role: I would implement a feature, assess its effectiveness, and then refine both the feature and the supporting code. This loop of continuous feedback helped me align the work with my initial vision.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Over multiple milestones, my coding style shifted from unstructured experiments to a more deliberate, modular, and maintainable approach. I balanced creativity with best practices, ensuring the final product was both functional and polished.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides problem-solving frameworks and technical knowledge that can be applied to virtually any field, helping me efficiently address challenges and build innovative solutions.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Through computational graphics, I have learned about geometry, rendering pipelines, and efficient data handling, which are invaluable when presenting complex information or demonstrating research findings in an educational setting.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Professionally, these skills allow me to create polished, interactive environments and simulations that can communicate ideas more effectively, whether in game development, architectural visualization, or other tech-focused careers.
