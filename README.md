üîç How Do I Approach Designing Software?
Overview: Designing software is a structured process that starts with understanding user needs and breaking down the problem into smaller components.
New Skills: My work on the project helped me improve at balancing technical constraints with user-centered design. Computational graphics were especially useful in creating engaging and interactive designs.
Design Process: I followed a process of requirement gathering, creating prototypes, and iterative refinement. Feedback loops played a key role in ensuring the design met the project objectives.
Future Applications: Modular design and continuous testing will remain core tactics in my future work, ensuring flexibility and scalability for any software project.
